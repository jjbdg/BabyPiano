# BabyPiano
For our project, by using the 4x4 keypad, we want to make a little piano. Each keypress will trigger a different note. Then by using a potentiometer, we will be able to change the tuning of the notes. Not only will each keypress trigger a different note, but it will also cause our iLED to change color. The intensity of the displayed colors will indicate where the current tuning is i.e. lower tunings have darker colors while higher tunings have lighter colors.

Use the 4x4 keypad to input a standard 8 note scale into a speaker. This will turn on an LED that changes colors depending on the note pressed. It will also include a button to activate playback which will play previously 8 pressed notes. There will also be a corresponding color for playback mode in order to denote the event to the user. During playback, the system will not register new inputs. The system will output to a speaker which plays the notes back to the user. A potentiometer will also be available to the user to add a tuning ability to the piano.
